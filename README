A project for practicing TDD on a common interview problem.  This extends its application to palindromic code points, including UTF-16 surrogate pairs.

This does not (yet) cover the following:
-Multi-character letters, such as Spanish's ch or Hungarian's dsz.
-Ligatures. 
-Non-mirror image Chinese palindromes, especially Xuanji Tu (Google this)
